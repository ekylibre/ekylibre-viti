* See our conventions ([Français](https://github.com/ekylibre/ekylibre/wiki/Conventions-de-d%C3%A9veloppement))
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented
  or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it
  and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a

  have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please
  isolate to its own commit so we can cherry-pick around it.
